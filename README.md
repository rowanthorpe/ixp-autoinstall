This is not using autotools or any kind of "packaging" system because it is
not really intended to be installed itself, but to be a temporary tool for
installing IXP-Manager. In that vein, as much as possible is being
self-contained in the ixpm-autoinstall.sh script. For "documentation" see the
comments at the top of that script.
