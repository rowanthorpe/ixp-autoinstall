This is the official BIG FAT WARNING:
=====================================

This is still highly experimental and should only be tried on bare VMs (or
fully backed-up systems that can afford a few hours offline to restore if
necessary) for now. Expect it to shred your system. It probably won't but I'm
not ready to bet money on it just yet. What it does is highly invasive by
nature so I will only remove this big fat warning after it has solidly proven
itself for a while...
